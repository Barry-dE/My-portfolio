      <p class="mt-8 mb-10">
        Over the past three years, I've worked as a software developer for a
        wide range of clients and with amazing product teams, gaining expertise
        and experience with a wide array of exciting technologies in the
        process. I am currently a software engineering student, and I think I'd
        say that I'm an inquisitive person who's interested in the "why" of
        things, the human mind, Greek and Norse mythology, science fiction, and
        a few other... weird topics?
        <br />
        More? I'm a developer (mostly on the back-end, although I have dabbled in
        the front-end here and there) who is working hard to reach the "senior" level
        of expertise. I'm working at WWIIS Services right now, and in my free time,
        I like to build things for you and me. It's a common misconception that I'm
        a nerd, but I'm not. You're pretty much exactly the type of person I want
        to hang out with if you're a fan of AJR (the band), Star Wars, or Star Trek
        (but I'd hang out with you even if you weren't). It also fascinates me to
        learn about and experiment with cutting-edge innovation, share my findings
        in "technical" articles, and launch brand-new products for the massesâ€”or,
        more lately, to create developer tools to help myself and others get stuff
        done faster.
